| Middle Income ($50K - $100K) |                                           29,660   |  $        15,051,848   |  $                  507  |  $      10,555,878       |  $       4,495,970     |
| Low Income (<$50K)           |                                           24,655   |  $        10,555,878   |  $                  428  |  $        3,750,951      |  $       6,804,927     |
| High Income (>$100K)         |                                             6,083  |  $          3,750,951  |  $                  617  |  NULL                    |  NULL                  |

We can see that in Average spent, High Income is up. But in total Spent, Middle Income is our batch.
We must decide wich segment to chase. It seems, from this info, that Middle and also Low income are the target ones.
