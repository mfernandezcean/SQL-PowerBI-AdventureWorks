### Let's check the real difference between this 'groups':

```sql
WITH CustomerSpending AS (
    SELECT 
        TotalChildren,
        COUNT(*) AS TotalCustomers,
        SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSpent,
        AVG(SalesAmount) AS AvgSpentPerCustomer
    FROM FactInternetSales S
    JOIN DimCustomer C ON S.CustomerKey = C.CustomerKey
    GROUP BY TotalChildren
)
SELECT 
    TotalChildren,
    TotalCustomers,
    TotalSpent,
    AvgSpentPerCustomer,
    LAG(TotalSpent) OVER (ORDER BY TotalChildren) AS PreviousGroupSpent,
    TotalSpent - LAG(TotalSpent) OVER (ORDER BY TotalChildren) AS DifferenceFromPrevious
FROM CustomerSpending
ORDER BY TotalChildren;
```

We have 3 different customer types. 1- No children, that are the one that buy the most. By far. 2 - With 1 and 2 children 3 - The rest

## Let's go deeper. First, No Children ðŸ‘¶: 

```sql
WITH NoChildrenPurchases AS (
    SELECT 
        PC.EnglishProductCategoryName AS Category,  
        SC.EnglishProductSubcategoryName AS Subcategory,  
        COUNT(S.SalesOrderNumber) AS PurchaseCount,  
        SUM(S.SalesAmount) AS TotalSpent,  
        AVG(S.SalesAmount) AS AvgSpentPerPurchase  
    FROM FactInternetSales S  
    JOIN DimCustomer C ON S.CustomerKey = C.CustomerKey  
    JOIN DimProduct P ON S.ProductKey = P.ProductKey  
    LEFT JOIN DimProductSubcategory SC ON P.ProductSubcategoryKey = SC.ProductSubcategoryKey  
    LEFT JOIN DimProductCategory PC ON SC.ProductCategoryKey = PC.ProductCategoryKey  
    WHERE C.TotalChildren = 0   
    GROUP BY PC.EnglishProductCategoryName, SC.EnglishProductSubcategoryName  
)
SELECT Top 5 
    Category,  
    Subcategory,  
    PurchaseCount,  
    TotalSpent,  
    ROUND((TotalSpent * 100.0 / SUM(TotalSpent) OVER ()), 2) AS PercentageOfTotalSales  
FROM NoChildrenPurchases  
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC;
```
