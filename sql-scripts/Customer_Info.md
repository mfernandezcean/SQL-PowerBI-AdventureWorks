# 🚗 Do Cars Influence Customer Behavior?  

## ❓ Why Are We Analyzing Car Ownership?  

We believe that **car ownership plays a key role in identifying different types of customer behaviors**.  

Understanding how many cars a customer owns helps us:  
✅ **Segment customers** based on lifestyle and spending habits  
✅ **Analyze purchasing trends**, especially for bike-related products  
✅ **Optimize marketing strategies** by targeting the right audience  

For example:  
- 🚴 **Customers with no cars** might buy bikes for transportation.  
- 🚗 **Customers with 1 car** may purchase bikes for fitness or leisure.  
- 🚙 **Customers with 2+ cars** could have higher spending power but different mobility needs.
